# Quantum vs. Classical AI for Plasma Thruster Design

This project provides a comparative framework for optimizing the design of a simulated plasma thruster using two distinct methodologies: a quantum approach based on the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and a classical AI approach using Bayesian Optimization with a Gaussian Process surrogate model.

The goal is to find the optimal set of thruster parameters (magnetic field, voltage, propellant flow, and channel material) that maximizes a performance score. This score is based on achieving target values for thrust, specific impulse (Isp), efficiency, and material erosion rate. The project serves as a demonstration of how different computational paradigms can tackle complex, multi-parameter optimization problems where function evaluations are computationally expensive.

## Problem Domain: Plasma Thruster Optimization

A plasma thruster is a type of electric propulsion system for spacecraft that uses electromagnetic fields to accelerate a plasma propellant. Its performance is a complex interplay of several design parameters. This simulation models that complexity.

The objective is to find a design `(b_field, voltage, flow, channel_material)` that minimizes the error between its calculated performance and a set of user-defined targets:

- **Thrust:** The force produced by the thruster.  
- **Specific Impulse (Isp):** A measure of efficiency; how much thrust is produced per unit of propellant.  
- **Efficiency:** The overall energy conversion efficiency.  
- **Erosion Rate:** The rate at which the thruster's channel walls erode, affecting its lifespan.  

The `ThrusterModel` class serves as our "ground truth" physics oracle, calculating a final performance score for any given set of parameters. This function is treated as a computationally expensive black box that we aim to optimize.

## Methodologies Compared

This code implements and visualizes two powerful optimization techniques to solve this complex, multi-parameter problem.

### Quantum Optimization (VQE)

The **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)** is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm designed to find the minimum eigenvalue of a Hamiltonian. We map our engineering problem to this framework:

- **Encoding:** The discrete design parameters are encoded into the computational basis states of a multi-qubit system. For example, if the B-Field is represented by 3 qubits, it can take on \(2^3 = 8\) discrete values.  
- **Hamiltonian Construction:** A diagonal Hamiltonian is constructed where each diagonal entry corresponds to the negative performance score of a specific basis state (i.e., a specific thruster design). The ground state (lowest energy state) of this Hamiltonian therefore represents the thruster configuration with the highest performance score.  
- **Variational Circuit:** A parameterized quantum circuit (the "ansatz," here `qml.StronglyEntanglingLayers`) is used to prepare a trial quantum state.  
- **Optimization Loop:** A classical optimizer (e.g., `AdamOptimizer`) iteratively adjusts the parameters of the quantum circuit to minimize the expectation value of the Hamiltonian.  
- **Solution:** The final optimized state has the highest probability of being measured in the basis state corresponding to the optimal thruster design.  

### Classical Surrogate Optimization (Bayesian)

This method uses **Bayesian Optimization**, a classical machine learning technique highly efficient for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate functions.

- **Surrogate Model:** It begins by sampling a few random points from the design space and evaluating their true performance using the `ThrusterModel`. It then trains a surrogate model — a Gaussian Process Regressor (`scikit-learn`) — to create an inexpensive, probabilistic approximation of the entire performance landscape.  
- **Acquisition Function:** Instead of searching blindly, it uses an acquisition function (here, **Upper Confidence Bound - UCB**) to intelligently decide the next most promising point to evaluate. UCB balances exploitation (sampling in areas the surrogate predicts are good) and exploration (sampling in areas with high uncertainty).  
- **Iterative Refinement:** The chosen point is evaluated with the true `ThrusterModel`, and the new data point is used to update and improve the surrogate model.  
- **Solution:** This loop continues for a set number of iterations, progressively converging on the best design by minimizing the number of calls to the expensive physics model.
